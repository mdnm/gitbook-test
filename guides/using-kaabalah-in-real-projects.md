# Using Kaabalah in real projects

Kaabalah is just computation.

So the main differences are runtime constraints.

### Common patterns (any platform)

#### Normalize inputs

* Names: `trim()` + `toUpperCase()`.
* Dates: be explicit about time zones.

#### Make results explainable

Show the final number.

Also show the steps.

That’s what makes people trust it.

#### Cache aggressively

Most outputs are deterministic.

Cache by input:

* Gematria: cache by `name`.
* Numerology: cache by `birthDate` and/or `YYYY-MM-DD`.
* Astrology: cache by `date + lat + lon + houseSystem + timeZone`.

#### Persist inputs, not just outputs

Persist raw inputs in your DB.

Recompute outputs on library upgrades.

### CLI apps

Best when you want repeatable, scriptable readings.

Implementation pattern:

* Parse args → compute → print JSON.
* Support `--pretty` for human output.
* Return non-zero exit code on invalid inputs.

Example feature ideas:

* `kaabalah gematria "DAVID"`
* `kaabalah life-path --date 1990-06-15`
* `kaabalah chart --date "1990-06-15 12:30" --tz America/New_York --lat ... --lon ...`

### Web apps

#### What can run fully in the browser?

* Numerology, gematria, tarot: yes.
* Astrology: needs Swiss Ephemeris WebAssembly.

#### SSR vs client

* SSR is great for deterministic content.
* Client is great for interactive UIs.

Practical pattern:

* Do astrology on the server.
* Ship only results to the client.

If you do astrology in the browser, follow:

* [WebAssembly Integration](webassembly.md)

#### Time zone input strategy

Store:

* `localDateTime` (what user typed)
* `timeZone` (IANA like `America/New_York`)

Then compute with those.

Avoid guessing offsets.

### Bots (Discord / Telegram / Slack)

Bots work best with _short_, structured outputs.

Practical pattern:

* Keep commands idempotent.
* Store user profile (name + birth date + location).
* Use buttons to reveal “details” (steps, meanings, etc.).

Good bot features:

* `/life-path` from saved birth date
* `/gematria word:` quick lookup
* `/tarot draw:3` + meaning

### Product design tips (new to esoterism)

You don’t need to teach tradition.

You need to teach your UI.

* Start with “number + label”.
* Add a one-line meaning.
* Add a “show steps” expand.
