# Concepts and terminology

This library computes _structured data_.

You decide how to interpret it in your app.

### Mental model

* **Module**: a domain of calculations (numerology, astrology, etc.).
* **Input**: usually a `Date`, a text, or birth data.
* **Result**: an object with values _and_ intermediate steps.

If you’re new to esoterism, treat results like any other scoring system.

Show the numbers.

Then show a short explanation next to each.

### Numerology

* **Life path**: a number derived from birth date.
* **Reduction**: repeatedly summing digits until a small number.
* **Master numbers**: special values (often `11`, `22`, `33`) preserved by some methods.
* **Synthesis**: the full sum before (or alongside) reduction.

When you build UI:

* Show both `originalSum` and `reducedValue`.
* Show the reduction steps if you want transparency.

### Gematria

* **Gematria**: mapping letters to numeric values.
* **Vowels vs consonants**: computed separately in this library.
* **Final forms (sofit)**: some letters change value when at word end.
* **Reverse gematria**: search for letter strings that match a target value.

Practical tip:

* Normalize input (`trim`, `toUpperCase`) before calculations.

### Astrology

* **Birth chart**: planetary longitudes + house cusps for a moment and place.
* **Houses**: a way to split the sky into 12 sectors.
* **House system**: the algorithm used (Placidius, Whole Sign, etc.).
* **Time zone**: the most common source of errors.

Practical tip:

* Always store the original local time + IANA time zone.
* Convert consistently before calling `getBirthChart`.

### Tarot

* **Deck**: the full list of cards.
* **Major arcana**: archetypal “big” cards.
* **Minor arcana**: suit-based cards.
* **Spread**: the set of drawn cards (and sometimes positions).

Practical tip:

* Treat tarot draws as random sampling.
* Persist the RNG seed if you want reproducible readings.

### Ifa

* **Odu**: symbolic numbers used in Ifa divination.
* This module derives Odu values from a date.

Practical tip:

* Treat this like a deterministic “daily signature” for a given date.

### Core (Tree of Life)

* **Tree of Life**: a graph of nodes (spheres, paths, correspondences).
* **Sphere (sephirah)**: one of the 10 main nodes.
* **Path**: a connection between spheres.
* **Correspondence**: any linked concept (planet, element, tarot card, etc.).

Practical tip:

* Use `TreeOfLife` when you want cross-module linking.
